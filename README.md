### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and a small business owner with extensive experience in leading teams and planning software architectures and guidelines. 

I developed a side project called MapsWalker, which helps users collect points of interest (POI) and keep them handy. Using advanced algorithms and AI, MapsWalker can generate new travel routes or find a restaurant for a drink after work.

I have strong expertise in NodeJS and Flutter, both of which were utilized in my side project. In my current job, I have also gained substantial experience with PHP (Laravel).

Passionate about technology and innovation, I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me or we could grab a cup of coffee and discuss further!
